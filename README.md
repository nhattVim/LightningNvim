and many more plugins that You will find incredibly useful.

## Dashboard images
How do I set my own dashboard images? Very easy! We're going
to use [Asthestarsfalll's img2art github repository](https://github.com/Asthestarsfalll/img2art) but
with a quick style fix from me, that's going to speed up the
process by 90%.

#### img2art Installation

##### Prerequisites
Due to the fix that we had to apply make sure that You have python's `poetry` installed on your system.
1. Clone [my fork](https://github.com/nxtkofi/img2art) of ASthestarsfalll's repository.
`git clone https://github.com/nxtkofi/img2art`
2. Install requirements inside the project root
```
cd img2art
python -m venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip install typer opencv-python numpy
```

We're now ready to go!
Run:
`poetry run python -m img2art.cli ~/path/to/picture.jpg --scale 0.3 --threshold 20 --save-raw ./test.lua --alpha`

What does it do:
- `--scale 0.3` This is scaling for our image. Pick a value so it fits into Your dashboard
- `--threshold 20` This is black-white threshold point. I suggest You play around it for a bit to see what's the best outcome for Your picture. Usually it's something between 20-150
- `./test.lua` This is where our output file will go and what name will it receive. Leave .lua extension. You may change the name.
- `--alpha` This makes sure that we get our picture in desired output style (ready to paste into alpha's dashboard!).

You should have Your output file now!
Move it into header_img folder.
Now to set a header image go ahead and check out my ./lua/custom/plugins/alpha.lua file.<br/>
Function `load_random_header()` loads random header image from header_img folder on nvim startup.

>[!important]
> Make sure you add `local header = load_random_header()` - otherwise Your image will not get initialized.


>[!tip]
> I also wrote a function `change_header()` which let's you change header when you press `w` in dashboard.


## Keymaps
All keymaps are defined in /lua/keymaps.lua (except for
those that were defined in plugin files - those are listed
at the end of keymaps.lua so You can easily find them!)
